Summary of Completed Tasks

Task 1: Introduction to React and its Development by Facebook
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications, developed and maintained by Facebook. It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. React is known for its component-based architecture, which encourages the creation of reusable UI components.

Task 2: Revise HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Topics (Done)

Task 3: Setting Up a React App
Setting up a React app involves using tools like Create React App, which provides a comfortable environment for learning and developing single-page applications in React. This task covers the initial setup, including creating a new React project, running the development server, and understanding the basic project structure.
We can do this by npx create-react-app my-app


Task 4: Learning JSX
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. It allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to create and manipulate DOM elements in React. JSX improves readability and provides a familiar syntax for those accustomed to HTML.

Task 5: Learning React Components
React components are the building blocks of a React application. They allow developers to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces. Components can be functional or class-based, and they manage their own state and lifecycle methods. This task involves understanding how to create and use components in a React application.
